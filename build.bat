:: Compiler Flags
::  - /EHsc -> Exception handling : If used with s (/EHsc), catches C++ exceptions only and tells the compiler to assume that functions declared as extern "C" never throw a C++ exception.
:: /DUNICODE /D_UNICODE -> Unicode preprocessor flags, in my case, fixes things like passing wchar_t pointers to functions expecting LPSTR, and other things as well.
:: /Fe -> Name of the exe file, used as /Fe%nameofexe%
cl /EHsc /DUNICODE /D_UNICODE /DWINGUI %APPNAME%.cpp /Fe%APPNAME%
cl /EHsc /DUNICODE /D_UNICODE %APPNAME%.cpp /Fe%APPNAME%-Console
